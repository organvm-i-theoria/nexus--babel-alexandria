    description: >
      A breathing organism that atomizes literary works into modular cells
      for creative recombination, translation, and scholarly exploration.
      Preserves classic texts at molecular levels (5-level glyph-seed hierarchy)
      and unlocks infinite creative and scholarly recombination through a
      temporal evolution spiral (expansion -> peak -> compression -> rebirth).

    title: "Genesis: Original Design Upload"
    summary: >
      Human-authored seed of the project. The massive Theoria Linguae Machina
      design document (~893 lines) was uploaded along with an initial roadmap.
      This established the conceptual architecture: multimodal NLP ingestion,
      5-level atomization, hypergraph projection, dual-mode governance, and
      the temporal evolution spiral.

    title: "Jules Agent Churn (Dead Branches)"
    summary: >
      82 commits across ~35 days by automated Jules agents (Sentinel, Bolt,
      Palette) performing the same handful of tasks repeatedly on disconnected
      branches that never merge. Sentinel added .gitignore and SECURITY.md
      ~25 times. Palette renamed the design doc to DESIGN.md ~30 times. Bolt
      added pyproject.toml and benchmarks ~15 times. Only one consolidation
      commit produced real code (HyperNode/HyperEdge in core/hypergraph/base.py).
      All branches are orphaned — none merged into main.
    accomplishments:
      - "Produced HyperNode/HyperEdge prototype (orphaned, not used)"

    summary: >
      Human direction takes over on main branch. Comprehensive README deployed
      (expanded to 4,394 words), MIT LICENSE added, .gitignore established,
      and minimal CI workflow created. Two follow-up commits fixed CI for
      pinned action SHAs and Unicode filenames. This phase established the
      real project foundation.

      edges, and event subscriptions. This connected the repo to the broader
      ORGANVM governance system.

      seed text registry with Project Gutenberg provisioning, remix/recombination
      engine (4 strategies), and 411-line ARC4N-specific test suite. Added
      Alembic migration for atom metadata column.
    accomplishments:
      - "Implemented rich glyph-seed metadata system"
      - "Created static glyph data lookups (phonemes, historic forms, mutations)"
      - "Built seed text registry (Homer, Dante, Whitman, Joyce, Shelley)"
