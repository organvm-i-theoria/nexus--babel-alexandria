## What This Is

**Nexus Babel Alexandria** is the **ARC4N Living Digital Canon** — a breathing organism that atomizes literary works into modular cells for creative recombination, translation, and scholarly exploration. It preserves classic texts at molecular levels and unlocks infinite creative and scholarly recombination through a temporal evolution spiral (expansion → peak → compression → rebirth).

The NLP engine underneath (aka "Theoria Linguae Machina") ingests multimodal documents (text, PDF, image, audio), atomizes them into a 5-level hierarchy (glyph-seed → syllable → word → sentence → paragraph), projects them into a knowledge graph, and provides multi-layer linguistic analysis with dual-mode governance (PUBLIC/RAW).

## ARC4N Concepts

- **5-Level Atomization**: Documents decompose into glyph-seeds (characters with rich metadata: phoneme, historic forms, visual mutations, thematic tags), syllabic clusters, words, sentences, and paragraphs. Each level is independently remixable.
- **Temporal Evolution Spiral**: Language evolves through cyclical phases — expansion (complexity grows), peak (maximum elaboration), compression (glyphs fuse, syllables collapse), rebirth (new sung-language forms emerge). This mirrors both natural linguistic drift and synthetic acceleration.
- **Seed Texts**: Canonical literary works (Homer, Dante, Whitman, Joyce, Shelley) serve as foundational material for the living canon. Each is atomized and available for evolution and remix.
- **Branch Timelines**: Every interaction creates a branch — a deterministic fork of the canon that can drift naturally, mutate synthetically, or remix across documents. Branches are replayable and comparable.
- **Remix/Recombination**: Atoms from different documents can be interleaved, blended by theme, temporally layered, or fused at the glyph level to create new compositions.
- **Natural vs Synthetic Drift**: Natural drift models historic linguistic shifts (Latin→Italian, Old English→Modern). Synthetic drift accelerates evolution beyond historical pace via user intervention or automation.

## Build & Run

Requires Python >=3.11.

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"              # dev includes pytest, httpx, alembic
pip install -e ".[dev,postgres]"     # add PostgreSQL support

# Dev server (defaults to SQLite, binds 0.0.0.0:8000)
make dev                             # uvicorn on :8000 with --reload

# Tests
make test                            # pytest -q (all 3 suites)
pytest tests/test_mvp.py -v          # MVP: ingestion, analysis, evolution, governance
pytest tests/test_wave2.py -v        # Wave-2: async jobs, plugins, metrics
pytest tests/test_arc4n.py -v        # ARC4N: glyph-seeds, remix, seed corpus
pytest tests/test_mvp.py::test_ingestion_completeness -v  # single test

# Database migrations (Alembic, targets SQLite by default via alembic.ini)
make db-upgrade                      # alembic upgrade head

# Background worker (processes async jobs from the jobs table)
make worker                          # python -m nexus_babel.worker
python -m nexus_babel.worker --once  # process one job and exit

# Corpus ingestion script
make ingest                          # python scripts/ingest_corpus.py

# Docker services (Postgres + Neo4j for production-like local dev)
docker compose up -d

# Other scripts
python scripts/load_test.py          # baseline load test
python scripts/repo_certainty_audit.py  # repo certainty audit
```

No linter or type checker is configured in pyproject.toml yet. CI (`ci-minimal.yml`) only validates repo structure (README exists, markdown files present) — it does not run tests or lint.

SDD specifications for all 9 feature domains live in `specs/NN-domain-name/{spec,plan,tasks}.md`. `MANIFEST.yaml` has the full annotated project history (files, threads, relations).

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. All settings use the `NEXUS_` prefix (handled by `pydantic-settings`). Key variables:

- `NEXUS_DATABASE_URL` — SQLite by default (`sqlite:///./nexus_babel.db`), PostgreSQL for docker
- `NEXUS_NEO4J_URI` / `NEXUS_NEO4J_USERNAME` / `NEXUS_NEO4J_PASSWORD` — optional; without Neo4j, the hypergraph uses an in-memory `LocalGraphCache`
- `NEXUS_RAW_MODE_ENABLED` — toggles RAW mode access
- `NEXUS_ASYNC_JOBS_ENABLED` — toggles async job submission
- `NEXUS_BOOTSTRAP_*_KEY` — dev API keys seeded at startup for viewer/operator/researcher/admin roles

## Architecture

### Application Factory

`create_app()` in `main.py` builds the FastAPI app, wires all services onto `app.state`, and seeds default API keys + governance policies in the lifespan handler. A module-level `app = create_app()` is used by uvicorn. Tests use `create_app(settings_override)` with an isolated SQLite + tmp_path.

### Source Layout

```

    text_utils.py      # Atomization (5-level: glyph-seed/syllable/word/sentence/paragraph), conflict detection
    glyph_data.py      # Static lookup tables for glyph-seed metadata (phonemes, historic forms, thematic tags)
    seed_corpus.py     # Seed text registry and Project Gutenberg provisioning
    remix.py           # Remix/recombination engine (interleave, thematic_blend, temporal_layer, glyph_collide)
    metrics.py         # In-memory counters + timing histograms
```

### Core Data Flow

1. **Ingest** (`POST /api/v1/ingest/batch`) — files resolved against `corpus_root`, checksummed, parsed by modality, atomized into 5 levels (with rich glyph-seed metadata), projected to hypergraph, canonicalization applied
2. **Analyze** (`POST /api/v1/analyze`) — runs 9 linguistic analysis layers (token, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse, sociolinguistics, rhetoric, semiotic) against a document or branch, through the plugin chain
3. **Evolve** (`POST /api/v1/evolve/branch`) — creates branching text evolution (natural_drift, synthetic_mutation, phase_shift, glyph_fusion, remix) with deterministic replay via seeded RNG. Natural drift covers ~25 historic linguistic shifts.
4. **Remix** (`POST /api/v1/remix`) — recombines atoms across documents using strategies: interleave, thematic_blend, temporal_layer, glyph_collide
5. **Provision** (`POST /api/v1/corpus/seed`) — provisions canonical seed texts from Project Gutenberg for atomization
6. **Governance** (`POST /api/v1/governance/evaluate`) — evaluates text against mode-specific policies; PUBLIC blocks on first hit, RAW allows with flagging

### Key Design Patterns

- **Dual-mode system**: PUBLIC mode enforces content filtering; RAW mode allows flagged terms for research. Mode access is controlled by both role level and per-key `raw_mode_enabled` flag.
- **Plugin chain**: Analysis layers run through a `PluginRegistry` with fallback chain (`ml_first` → `deterministic`, or `deterministic` only). Each layer produces output + confidence + provider provenance.
- **Hypergraph dual-write**: Document/atom projections write to both a `LocalGraphCache` (always) and Neo4j (when configured). Integrity checks compare both.
- **Async job queue**: Jobs table with lease-based execution, retry with exponential backoff (`[2, 10, 30]s`), idempotency keys, and artifact tracking. Worker polls and processes.
- **Branch evolution determinism**: Event processing uses seeded RNG derived from `sha256(event_type:seed:text_hash)`, ensuring identical inputs produce identical outputs for reproducible replay.

### Auth Model

Four roles in ascending order: `viewer` → `operator` → `researcher` → `admin`. API key auth via `X-Nexus-API-Key` header. Bootstrap keys are seeded at startup from settings.

### Database

SQLAlchemy 2.0 with `mapped_column`. SQLite for dev/test, PostgreSQL for docker. Key models: `Document`, `Atom`, `Branch`, `BranchEvent`, `AnalysisRun`, `LayerOutput`, `Job`, `JobAttempt`, `ModePolicy`, `PolicyDecision`, `AuditLog`, `ProjectionLedger`, `DocumentVariant`.

Alembic migrations in `alembic/versions/`: `20260218_0001_initial` (core tables), `20260218_0002_wave2_alpha` (jobs + checkpoints), `20260223_0003_add_atom_metadata` (glyph-seed metadata column on atoms). The `alembic.ini` defaults to SQLite; for PostgreSQL, set `sqlalchemy.url` or use the `NEXUS_DATABASE_URL` env var in `alembic/env.py`. Migration naming: `YYYYMMDD_NNNN_description.py`.

### Service Dependency Chain

Services are manually wired in `create_app()` onto `app.state` (no DI container). Key dependency flows:

- `ingestion.py` → `text_utils.py` → `glyph_data.py` (atomization chain)
- `ingestion.py` → `canonicalization.py` (variant linking after ingest)
- `ingestion.py` → `hypergraph.py` (graph projection)
- `analysis.py` → `plugins.py` → `rhetoric.py` (plugin fallback chain)
- `remix.py` → `evolution.py` (remix creates branch events)
- `worker.py` → `jobs.py` (polls and executes queued jobs)

### Route Endpoint Pattern

All endpoints in `api/routes.py` follow a consistent pattern: acquire session via `_session(request)` → authenticate via `_require_auth(min_role)` dependency → enforce mode via `_enforce_mode()` → delegate to service → `session.commit()` → return Pydantic response. Errors trigger `session.rollback()`. Sessions are always closed in `finally` blocks. Add new endpoints by following this same pattern.

### Testing Approach

Tests use `FastAPI.TestClient` with an isolated SQLite database per test via `tmp_path`. The `conftest.py` provides `test_settings`, `client`, `auth_headers` (all 4 roles), and `sample_corpus` (text, yaml, conflict yaml, PDF, image, WAV) fixtures. Write new tests by depending on these fixtures — `client` yields a `TestClient` bound to a fresh app with its own DB. Use `auth_headers["operator"]` (or appropriate role) as the `headers` kwarg on requests.

## Routes

Non-API routes (no auth): `GET /healthz` (health check), `GET /metrics` (in-memory counters), `GET /app/{view}` (frontend shell for `corpus`, `hypergraph`, `timeline`, `governance`), `GET /` (redirects to `/app/corpus`).
