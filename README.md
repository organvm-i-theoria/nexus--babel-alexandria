# Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)

Welcome to the Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS) repository.

## Overview

RLOS is a paradigm-shifting computational linguistics framework—a **Theoria Linguae Machina** that embodies theoretical sophistication, practical implementation, and ethical governance. It utilizes a nine-layer plexus architecture with bidirectional information flow, replacing linear NLP pipelines with a dynamic network modeling genuine linguistic cognition.

## Documentation

*   **[Design Document](DESIGN.md)**: Comprehensive architectural specifications, formal mathematical foundations, and system design.
*   **[Roadmap](roadmap.md)**: Exhaustive implementation roadmap and task decomposition.

## Current Status

We are currently in **Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure**.
See `roadmap.md` for detailed task lists.

## Getting Started

*(Instructions for setting up the environment will be added here as we progress through Phase 0)*
